# Deploy and Install WordPress with Ansible

This is an ansible playbook to deploy and install WordPress on Ubuntu with:

* MariaDB
* Apache2
* letsencrypt (SSL)

Still requires final browser-based install (site name, admin user, password).

TODO:

* Complete browser install
* Add plugins based on list
* Mechanisms for SSL management beyond creation
